# Victoria-3-Resources-and-Pop-Mod
This is a mod that I have made for the game Victoria 3 from Paradox Interactive: https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/victoria-3/about


The focus in this mod is about the need of population (or "pops"), as well as resources in the world map:
- Adding entertainment (for pops with Standard of Living (SoL) higher than 25), to simulate the rich people' need for entertainment. This could be done by hunting (small arms), yacht usage (steamers and clippers), but the default choice is services.
- Increase base price for services, so that Urban Centres stayed profitable late game. The need for services is also bumped up.
- Increase the need of pops for food, as well as adding the amount of fertilizers needed to produce food.

**For migration in game, generally:**
- The mass migration mechanics was bumped up (increase amount of people migrated, which is nerfed in patch 1.2);
- Pops will be more inclined to migrate if they are unemployed.

**For population growth:**
- Birth rate is now changed by literacy (100% literacy corresponds to 20% reduction in birth rate).
- Birth rate could change more from women rights (Legal Guardianship gave 10% increase, Propertied Women gave 2.5% increase, Women in the Workforce gave 5% decrease, while Women Suffrage gave 10% decrease).
- Giving rights for children also decrease birth rate (by 2.5% and 5% for Restricted Child Labor and Compulsory Primary School).
- The birth rate curve is also changed (it peaked at SoL 16 and stop decrease by SoL 32).

**For resources:**
- The amount of potential Logging Camp have increased globally (max potential are in Amazon, Siberia and Canada, with provinces having 50 to 80 logging camps).
- The amount of oil is added for Texas and California (2 regions with the majority of oil production globally for Victorian era). Texas and Maracaibo are now having traits to boost throughputs.
- The amount of resources, arable land (in general) have been added for Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. (This idea is based from Australia Flavour Pack: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2939278238).
- Adding state traits for electricity to mountain regions (to simulate hydroelectric dams).

**Miscellaneous:**
- Obsessions have been added for multiple cultures: Russian with tea and liquor, Belarussians with liquor, Australians with liquor, North and South Germans with porcelains, Platineans (culture in game for Argentinians and Uruguayans), Kazakhs and Mongols with meats, Turkish with coffee, and so on.
- Change in attack and defense stats for ships (so Dreadnought and Battleship will be less likely to be sunken by Man-of-War).
- Adding historical Australian party names.

I hope that if you find my ideas fun, you could give me potential feedbacks!
